"As a business guy I have no place in programming." Ten years ago you could have gotten away with that statement. Today you say that to your colleagues and they scoff at you before they go back to their computers to fix real problems and do real work.

If you want to do something useful start by learning Javascript . In these days when the browser is central to all computer use knowing "the language of the browser" is the most important step. A few years ago Javascript potential was uncertain and many programmers considered it useless. These days however competent programmers have identified Javascript real potential and uses and it has gone from a toy language to the main language of the browser. It has become one of the most useful languages of this era. Every developer needs at least a basic understanding of Javascript. A developer who knows Javascript is the rockstar of the company and is in constant demand by employers. Our online Javascript

course will get you started by teaching all the essential aspects of coding in Javascript. So... what''s it gonna be? Do you want to supercharge your career and be in constant demand by employers?

Everybody has a great idea for an app. The problem is, not many of those people have the skills or knowledge required to make that idea a reality. Building an app, regardless of its simplicity or platform, requires certain technical know-how like coding, UX/UI design, and more. App Inventor 2, however, cuts through all of the smoke and allows anyone – even those with no coding experience – to build Android apps from the ground up. This course will teach you how.

Build Apps Without Learning Code!

Gain a practical understanding of programming basics
Navigate and use App Inventor 2 efficiently and effectively
Create and build your own apps for Android
Test and update your apps after you''ve built them
Learn how to publish your app to Google''s Play Store

You are correct! I will show you how linear regression can still be applied.
